# PyBer_Analysis
  In this assignment, I wanted to synthesize the key metrics for ride-sharing data by city type by creating a summary DataFrame. Furthermore, I created a line graph that would visiually demonstrate the disparities between city types and provide data to support my recommendations that I would give the CEO. I cleaned and analyzed the data by using key concepts I used in this module such as creating DataFrames and utilizing the groupby() function. 
What can be said about the summary DataFrame and multiple-line graph with respect to the ride-sharing data among the different city types? Include images of the summary DataFrame table and the multiple-line graph in these results.
A short summary of the results.


The second paragraph should include the following:
  The main challenge I ran into was formatting the 
What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.
Explain how you overcame any challenges or difficulties, and include what technical analysis you use to overcome the challenges or difficulties.

The third paragraph should include the following:

Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?
